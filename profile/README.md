# Shimmerwhere

*where cats dream in iridescent light*

## What is Shimmerwhere?

A universe under construction — a collection of digital worlds where every project feels like a memory you never had.

Built with:
- VHS haze and film grain
- Iridescent shimmer
- Cat-coded chaos
- Lavender tea and insomnia

**Not everything meaningful announces its arrival.**

## Design Philosophy

> *"Here, code is not merely written — it's directed.*  
> *Every repo, a scene.*  
> *Every commit, a cut."*

We believe in:
- Soft over sharp
- Haze over clarity
- Glow over shadow
- Whisper over shout

All projects styled with **catgloss** — our custom CSS framework for atmospheric interfaces.

## Launch

**January 2027**

Until then, we're building quietly — one cat, one line of code, one frame of feeling at a time.
